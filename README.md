# Libft

This project creates a library with standard libc functions and several other generic functions, which will be used for other 42 projects.

The purpose is not to reinvent the wheels, but to help us develop a deep understanding of the standard libc functions and how to use them.

Technical considerations:

Allowed functions: malloc, free, write.

All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary.
